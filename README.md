## Sources

This tool uses the Unicode Character Database. It can be downloaded from `http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/`. Move all text files into `UCD/`, extract `Unihan.zip` and move the `Unihan` folder contents into `Unihan/`.

Codepage mapping files are from `ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/`. Move the appropriate text files into `Mappings/`, and check the references in `Mappings/mappings.txt`.

Download the latest production (i.e. compressed) jQuery from `https://jquery.com/download` into `libs/`, and check the reference at the top of `unicode.html`.

Download the latest bootstrap from `https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/` and extract the zip file. Rename the folder to `bootstrap` and place it in `libs/`.

Download `randomColor.js` from `https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor` and place it in `libs/`.
