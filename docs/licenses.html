CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer 
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator 
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work 
of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for 
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and 
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without 
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate 
in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any 
form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation 
commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to 
promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of 
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater 
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation 
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 
with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner 
of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply 
CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with 
knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and 
the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be 
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright 
and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are 
not limited to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, 
communicate, and translate a Work;

ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or 
likeness depicted in a Work;

iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, 
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and 
reuse of data in a Work;

vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the 
legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation 
thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the 
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national 
implementations thereof.

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, 
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably 
and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's 
Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, 
whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims 
and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) 
for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including 
future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for 
any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including 
without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 
"Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of 
the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and 
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to 
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal 
or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the 
public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be 
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the 
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into 
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the 
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected 
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, 
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright 
and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) 
for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including 
future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for 
any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including 
without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 
was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for 
any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable 
law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate 
the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms 
that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright 
and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and 
causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to 
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, 
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or 
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory 
or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or 
the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or 
absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest 
extent permissible under applicable law.

c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons 
that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation 
any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer 
disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions 
or other rights required for any use of the Work.

d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a 
party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to 
this CC0 or use of the Work.
